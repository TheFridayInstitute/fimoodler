## Overview

The `fimoodler` package has the functions you need to fetch, manipulate, and format data from the Friday Institute Moodle database for the purpose of analyzing courses.  There are functions to pull information about enrollments, activity logs (i.e. trace data), and plugin specific information (e.g. questionnaires, surveys, and certificates) from the database.
